# SVHN Deep Learning Project

This git repo contains code I made for the deep learning problem of identifying the sequences of numbers in Google street view images of house numbers. The code will be Python using Tensorflow and possibly Keras for a layer of abstraction on top of the basic Tensorflow. The code will be tested on Ubuntu 16 using Tensorflow 1.
